      <h3> 1. sketches </h3>
      <p>
        My design process started out with multiple ideation sketches for a large banner-style poster with tips on getting started with Discord. Since we were required by the teaching staff to incorporate signs and symbols, I decided to make a design
        with the Discord logo wearing a cape to symbolize it as a powerful tool that can save the day.

      <h3> 2. initial renders </h3>
      <p>
        Since we were required by the teaching staff to incorporate signs and symbols, I decided to make a design with the Discord logo wearing a cape to symbolize it as a powerful tool that can save the day. After creating these sketches, I then made a higher fidelity mock-up in Adobe Illustrator. I also ended up placing Discord’s name on a shooting star to symbolize how it can be the answer to students’ wishes for an easier way to communicate on projects online.

      <h3> 3. final product </h3>
      <p>
        My initial feedback from my peers was that a banner-style poster with so much information would be overwhelming for students to look at. Based on their critiques, I decided to shrink it down to an A0 size (841mm x 1189mm) by cutting out the steps and replacing it with a summary of Discord’s features.

      <h3> 4. reflection </h3>
      <p>
        Working on this project made me realize how important it is for a poster to able to get a lot of information across with just a quick glance. My first design had too much content and would require a passerby to thoroughly read through all of it to get the full meaning behind the poster. However, I feel that the changes I made allowed for a much clearer message to be communicated in a much quicker way.
