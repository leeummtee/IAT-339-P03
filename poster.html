        Project for a Design Communication and Collaboration class. Students were given a two-week timeframe to design posters for SIAT advisors to use when welcoming SIAT freshmen.

      <h3> a. sketches </h3>
      <p>
        My design process started out with multiple ideation sketches for a large banner-style poster with tips on getting started with Discord. Since we were required by the teaching staff to incorporate signs and symbols, I wanted to make a design with the Discord logo wearing a cape to symbolize it as a powerful tool for working on online group projects.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- using both picture and source to change the image as the window is resized. Using lec 5 responsive img example as reference -->
    <div class="block-poster" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos="fade-up">
      <img class="almost-full-width-img" src="images/poster-sketches-desktop.png" alt="logo and poster ideation sketches">
      <!-- <source class="block-poster" media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="images/poster-sketches-desktop.png 1x"> -->

    <div class="block-poster">
      <h3> b. initial render </h3>
      <p>
        Using my sketches as reference, I started creating my first mock-up in Adobe Illustrator.
        Seeing things in a higher fidelity made me realize that Discord's name needed to stand out more, so I also ended up placing its name on a shooting star to symbolize how it can be the answer to students’ wishes for an easier way to communicate on projects online.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block-poster" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos="fade-up">

    <div class="block-poster">
      <h3> c. outcome </h3>
      <p>
        My initial feedback from my peers was that a banner-style poster with so much information would be overwhelming for students to look at. Based on their critiques, I decided to shrink it down to an A0 size by cutting out the steps and replacing it with a summary of Discord’s features.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block-poster" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos="fade-up">
      <img class="almost-full-width-img" src="images/final-poster.png" alt="final poster & render">
    </div>

    <div class="block-poster">
      <h2 class="divider"> 03. reflection </h2>
      <p>
        Working on this project made me realize how important it is for a poster to able to get a lot of information across with just a quick glance. My first design had too much content and would require a passerby to thoroughly read through all of
        it to get the full meaning behind the poster. However, I feel that the changes I made allowed for a much clearer message to be communicated in a much quicker way.
