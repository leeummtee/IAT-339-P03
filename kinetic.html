        Final project for a Digital Image Design class. Students were given a three-week timeframe to communicate motion through kinetic typography based on a clip of dialogue.

      <p>
        Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop

      <p>
        Since boxing is one of my interests, I decided to make my work based on Muhammad Ali's iconic "I'll show you how great I am" speech. I knew I had to incorporate bold and tough-looking typefaces such as Century Gothic and Tough Mudder in order to match his bold claims and tough persona.

        <!-- My process began with making an initial storyboard of my initial ideas for feedback. After being told that I was heading in the right direction, I decided to take my ideas a step further by incorporating even more graphics to
        replace some of the text. I knew at the time that it was an ambitious decision since implementing so many graphics would add much more work to an already time-consuming project. However, it was a challenge I was willing to face so
        that I could do the iconic speech justice. -->

        With this storyboard as reference, I began creating the graphics in Adobe Illustrator and splitting the layers in Photoshop. This way they could be directly imported into After Effects where I would animate them alongside the text.

      <p>
        This project was quite a challenge as it was my first time taking a design course and working with Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects. However, it allowed me to develop a strong foundation for these programs which helped me in my future design courses. This project also gave me a lot of confidence knowing that I was able to step out of my comfort zone and create something worth showcasing.
