      <h2> storyboards </h2>
      <p>
        My process began with making an initial storyboard of my initial ideas for feedback. After being told that I was heading in the right direction, I decided to take my ideas a step further by incorporating even more graphics to
        replace some of the text. I knew at the time that it was an ambitious decision since implementing so many graphics would add much more work to an already time-consuming project. However, it was a challenge I was willing to face so
        that I could do the iconic speech justice.

      <h2> graphics & animating </h2>
      <p>
        With this storyboard as reference, I began creating the graphics in Adobe Illustrator and splitting the layers in Photoshop. This way they could be directly imported into After Effects where I would animate them alongside the text.

        This project was quite a challenge as it was my first design course and my first time working with Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects.  However, the more I put time into it,
        the more I realized that I was actually enjoying the process. As a result, this class and project were some of the things that pushed me to pursue a design major.
